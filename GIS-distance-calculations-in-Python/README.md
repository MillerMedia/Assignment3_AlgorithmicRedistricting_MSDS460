### Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM)
 Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) grid system [Zone map](https://gisgeography.com/utm-universal-transverse-mercator-projection/)
 The UTM System is not a projection like other map projections; 
 rather, it is a global system of narrow mapping zones,  
 each with its own instance of the transverse Mercator 
 coordinate projection method. 120 zones means 120 map projections,
 sizty zones each in the northern and southern hemispheres.
 Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinate system is 
 a standard set of map projections with a central meridian
 for each six-degree-ide UTM zone, where the zone is 
 determined by longitude. That is, the UTM
 projection flattens the sphere 60 times by shifting 
 the cylinder central meridian 6 degrees for each zone. 
 UTM gives cartographers a map to work with always in meters.
 By being local to the zone and in meters, it is 
 especially well suited for distance measurement as needed
 for device localization. UTM is not so good
 at drawing large-scale maps across zones.
